## 📖 Description

Surface reconstruction and novel view rendering from sparse-view images are challenging. 
Signed Distance Function (SDF)-based methods struggle with fine details, while 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based approaches lack global geometry coherence. 
We propose a novel hybrid method that combines the strengths of both approaches: SDF captures coarse geometry to enhance 3DGS-based rendering, while newly rendered images from 3DGS refine the details of SDF for accurate surface reconstruction. As a result, our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis on the DTU and MobileBrick datasets.
